,Understanding Housing Support (Previously GRH),

,https://mn.gov/dhs/people-we-serve/adults/economic-assistance/housing/programs-and-services/housing-support.jsp,
,"In Minnesota, the former Group Residential Housing (GRH) program is now known as Housing Support. This program provides state-funded cash assistance, including room and board, for individuals residing in licensed or registered group living arrangements",

,Program info,
,"The Housing Support program pays for room and board for seniors and adults with disabilities who have low incomes. The program aims to reduce and prevent people from living in institutions or becoming homeless.Over 20,000 Minnesotans receive Housing Support assistance each month to help pay for rent and food.",

,"About 27% of program recipients also receive Housing Support supplemental service funding to provide other services, including but not limited to: medication reminders, assistance with transportation, arranging for meetings and appointments, and arranging for medical and social services.Information for providers about rates for these programs is available on the Housing Support Payment Rates page.Information on recent updates to Housing Support is available on the Housing Support and MSA Updates page.",

,Eligibility,
,"You must meet a combination of eligibility requirements set by the Supplemental Security Income program or General Assistance program to qualify for assistance. There are also income and asset limits. Generally, the program serves:",
,People 65 or older,
,"People younger than 65 who have a condition that limits their self-sufficiency. For example, it may be a physical or mental health disability, visual impairment or chemical dependency.",

,Benefits,
,"Your housing provider will receive payments to pay for your rent, utilities, food, household supplies and other necessities.Effective July 1, 2024, the current maximum Housing Support housing payment is $1,170 per month for group settings. The maximum Housing Support housing payment is $1,220 per month for community settings. The amount for individual participants may vary. 

Depending on your income, you may have to pay a portion of the Housing Support housing rate directly to your housing provider. 

The program can pay for additional supportive services in some settings if you do not qualify for home and community-based waiver programs.",

,"GRH Is a rent subsidy for people living in group settings, and any leftover money goes into a ""pooled fund"" to help pay for rent and food for others in the group.",

,How HS Works,

,"The client gets a letter to tell them how much of their rent they are obligated to pay directly. Mostly its 30% of their income. Then Affinity pays the rest. If they have no income, their obligation will be $0.00",

,"Current maximum Housing Support housing payment is $1,170 per month for group settings and  $1,220 per month for community settings. (To be changed soon)",

,"ARC then Receives money directly from the state and if the client is obligated to pay an amount, depending on where they live they'll pay either Affinity (for site based locations) or the landlord directly (for offsite locations)",

,Admin fee of 5% ,

,Worked Example: if client DOES have income and IS eligible to pay % ,
,- Total HS benefit $1220,
,- The rent is $1100,
,- ARC Receives $890 benefit payment. | Client obligation 30% of rent amount $330 (890+330=1220 total),
,👉🏽 Pooled fund computation would be: (benefit rec'd) $890+(client obligation) $330-(rent amount) $1100 = $120 goes to the pool,


,"Worked Example: if client DOES NOT have income, and does not have an obligation to pay a  % ",
,- Total HS Benefit: $1220,
,- The rent is $1100,
,- ARC Receives $1220 benefit payment. | Client obligation 0% (due to no income),
,👉🏽 Pooled fund computation would be: (benefit rec'd) $1220+(client obligation) $0.00 -(rent amount) $1100 = $120 goes to the pool,


,Worked Example: if clients rent is MORE than total benefit,
,- Total HS Benefit: $1220,
,- The rent is $1300,
,- ARC Receives $1220 benefit payment. | Client obligation 0% (due to no income),
,👉🏽 Pooled fund computation would be: (benefit rec'd) $1220+(client obligation) $0.00 -(rent amount) $1300 = - $120 comes FROM the pool if the money is there. ,
